# Spotify_Add_Block

Hello everyone, people!)
I have been using this solution for a couple of weeks and it still works, it is good news. But the application is updated every couple of days and I can't get it off. I came to such a simple solution, where when you start Spotify through a self-written exe file, 2 files are replaced, which are responsible for blocking ads. Maybe someone will be useful, I'll leave it here.)
I attach the baht file itself and the finished exe* file.

* - Exe file - Not for replacement! It only replaces 2 files needed to bypass ads and launches your Original Spotify exe file!
